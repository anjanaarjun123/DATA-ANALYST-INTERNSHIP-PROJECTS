## 🔹 1. HR Analytics – Predict Employee Attrition

### 📌 Objective
Identify key reasons behind employee attrition and build a machine learning model to predict future attrition, enabling HR to retain top talent.

### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, SHAP
- Power BI: Dashboard development

### 🔍 Steps Involved
1. **EDA** – Visualized attrition patterns across departments and salary bands.
2. **Data Preprocessing** – One-hot encoding, feature selection.
3. **Modeling** – Built Random Forest classifier (~85% accuracy).
4. **Interpretability** – Used SHAP for understanding feature importance.
5. **Dashboard** – Created Power BI visuals for stakeholders.

### 📁 Output Files
- `HR ATTRITION PROJECT1.ipynb`
- `HR ATTRITION DASHBOARD.pbix` – Power BI dashboard
- `HR ATTRITION PROJECT REPORT` – PROJECT REPORT
- `HR_Attrition_cleaned.xlsx`-Cleaned file
## 🔹 2. 
---Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction Model

### 📌 Objective
Predict the future lifetime value of customers based on their transaction history. This helps businesses in targeted marketing and retention strategies.

### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, XGBoost, Scikit-learn
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Excel: Data inspection

### 🔍 Steps Involved
1. **Data Cleaning** – Removed invalid transactions, missing values.
2. **Feature Engineering** – Calculated Recency, Frequency, AOV, Tenure.
3. **Model Building** – Trained XGBoost Regressor for predicting CLV.
4. **Evaluation** – MAE and RMSE metrics.
5. **Customer Segmentation** – Classified customers into Low, Medium, High value.
6. **Exported Results** – Saved `predicted_clv.csv` and `customer_segments_clv.csv`.

### 📁 Output Files
- `Customer_Lifetime_VAlue_Prediction.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with all steps
- `predicted_clv.csv` – Predicted CLV values
- `customer_segments_clv.csv` – Segmented customers
